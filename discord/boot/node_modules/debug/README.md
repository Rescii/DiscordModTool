[Brace expansion](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Brace-Expansion.html), 
as known from sh/bash, in JavaScript.

[![testling badge](https://ci.testling.com/juliangruber/brace-expansion.png)](https://ci.testling.com/juliangruber/brace-expansion)

## Example

```js
var expand = require('brace-expansion');

expand('file-{a,b,c}.jpg')
// => ['file-a.jpg', 'file-b.jpg', 'file-c.jpg']

expand('-v{,,}')
// => ['-v', '-v', '-v']

expand('file{0..2}.jpg')
// => ['file0.jpg', 'file1.jpg', 'file2.jpg']

expand('file-{a..c}.jpg')
// => ['file-a.jpg', 'file-b.jpg', 'file-c.jpg']

expand('file{2..0}.jpg')
// => ['file2.jpg', 'file1.jpg', 'file0.jpg']

expand('file{0..4..2}.jpg')
// => ['file0.jpg', 'file2.jpg', 'file4.jpg']

expand('file-{a..e..2}.jpg')
// => ['file-a.jpg', 'file-c.jpg', 'file-e.jpg']

expand('file{00..10..5}.jpg')
// => ['file00.jpg', 'file05.jpg', 'file10.jpg']

expand('{{A..C},{a..c}}')
// => ['A', 'B', 'C', 'a', 'b', 'c']

expand('ppp{,config,oe{,conf}}')
// => ['ppp', 'pppconfig', 'pppoe', 'pppoeconf']
```

## API

```js
var expand = require('brace-expansion');
```

### var expanded = expand(str)

Return an array of all possible and valid expansions of `str`. If none are
found, `[str]` is returned.

Valid expansions are:

```js
/^(.*,)+(.+)?$/
// {a,b,...}
```

A comma separated list of options, like `{a,b}` or `{a,{b,c}}` or `{,a,}`.

```js
/^-?\d+\.\.-?\d+(\.\.-?\d+)?$/
// {x..y[..incr]}
```

A numeric sequence from `x` to `y` inclusive, with optional increment.
If `x` or `y` start with a leading `0`, all the numbers will be padded
to have equal length. Negative numbers and backwards iteration work too.

```js
/^-?\d+\.\.-?\d+(\.\.-?\d+)?$/
// {x..y[..incr]}
```

An alphabetic sequence from `x` to `y` inclusive, with optional increment.
`x` and `y` must be exactly one character, and if given, `incr` must be a
number.

For compatibility reasons, the string `${` is not eligible for brace expansion.

## Installation

With [npm](https://npmjs.org) do:

```bash
npm install brace-expansion
```

# buffer-crc32

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/brianloveswords/buffer-crc32.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/brianloveswords/buffer-crc32)

crc32 that works with binary data and fancy character sets, outputs
buffer, signed or unsigned data and has tests.

Derived from the sample CRC implementation in the PNG specification: http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/#D-CRCAppendix

# install
```
npm install buffer-crc32
```

# example
```js
var crc32 = require('buffer-crc32');
// works with buffers
var buf = Buffer([0x00, 0x73, 0x75, 0x70, 0x20, 0x62, 0x72, 0x6f, 0x00])
crc32(buf) // -> <Buffer 94 5a ab 4a>

// has convenience methods for getting signed or unsigned ints
crc32.signed(buf) // -> -1805997238
crc32.unsigned(buf) // -> 2488970058

// will cast to buffer if given a string, so you can
// directly use foreign characters safely
crc32('自動販売機') // -> <Buffer cb 03 1a c5>

// and works in append mode too
var partialCrc = crc32('hey');
var partialCrc = crc32(' ', partialCrc);
var partialCrc = crc32('sup', partialCrc);
var partialCrc = crc32(' ', partialCrc);
var finalCrc = crc32('bros', partialCrc); // -> <Buffer 47 fa 55 70>
```

# tests
This was tested against the output of zlib's crc32 method. You can run
the tests with`npm test` (requires tap)

# see also
https://github.com/alexgorbatchev/node-crc, `crc.buffer.crc32` also
supports buffer inputs and return unsigned ints (thanks @tjholowaychuk).
