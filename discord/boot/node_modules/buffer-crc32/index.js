an be used to allow usage of third party schemas with format(s) for which you don't have definitions, but still fail if another unknown format is used. If `format` keyword value is [$data reference](#data-reference) and it is not in this array the validation will fail.
  - `"ignore"` - to log warning during schema compilation and always pass validation (the default behaviour in versions before 5.0.0). This option is not recommended, as it allows to mistype format name and it won't be validated without any error message. This behaviour is required by JSON Schema specification.
- _schemas_: an array or object of schemas that will be added to the instance. In case you pass the array the schemas must have IDs in them. When the object is passed the method `addSchema(value, key)` will be called for each schema in this object.
- _logger_: sets the logging method. Default is the global `console` object that should have methods `log`, `warn` and `error`. See [Error logging](#error-logging). Option values:
  - custom logger - it should have methods `log`, `warn` and `error`. If any of these methods is missing an exception will be thrown.
  - `false` - logging is disabled.


##### Referenced schema options

- _schemaId_: this option defines which keywords are used as schema URI. Option value:
  - `"$id"` (default) - only use `$id` keyword as schema URI (as specified in JSON Schema draft-06/07), ignore `id` keyword (if it is present a warning will be logged).
  - `"id"` - only use `id` keyword as schema URI (as specified in JSON Schema draft-04), ignore `$id` keyword (if it is present a warning will be logged).
  - `"auto"` - use both `$id` and `id` keywords as schema URI. If both are present (in the same schema object) and different the exception will be thrown during schema compilation.
- _missingRefs_: handling of missing referenced schemas. Option values:
  - `true` (default) - if the reference cannot be resolved during compilation the exception is thrown. The thrown error has properties `missingRef` (with hash fragment) and `missingSchema` (without it). Both properties are resolved relative to the current base id (usually schema id, unless it was substituted).
  - `"ignore"` - to log error during compilation and always pass validation.
  - `"fail"` - to log error and successfully compile schema but fail validation if this rule is checked.
- _extendRefs_: validation of other keywords when `$ref` is present in the schema. Option values:
  - `"ignore"` (default) - when `$ref` is used other keywords are ignored (as per [JSON Reference](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pbryan-zyp-json-ref-03#section-3) standard). A warning will be logged during the schema compilation.
  - `"fail"` (recommended) - if other validation keywords are used together with `$ref` the exception will be thrown when the schema is compiled. This option is recommended to make sure schema has no keywords that are ignored, which can be confusing.
  - `true` - validate all keywords in the schemas with `$ref` (the default behaviour in versions before 5.0.0).
- _loadSchema_: asynchronous function that will be used to load remote schemas when `compileAsync` [method](#api-compileAsync) is used and some reference is missing (option `missingRefs` should NOT be 'fail' or 'ignore'). This function should accept remote schema uri as a parameter and return a Promise that resolves to a schema. See example in [Asynchronous compilation](#asynchronous-schema-compilation).


##### Options to modify validated data

- _removeAdditional_: remove additional properties - see example in [Filtering data](#filtering-data). This option is not used if schema is added with `addMetaSchema` method. Option values:
  - `false` (default) - not to remove additional properties
  - `"all"` - all additional properties are removed, regardless of `additionalProperties` keyword in schema (and no validation is made for them).
  - `true` - only additional properties with `additionalProperties` keyword equal to `false` are removed.
  - `"failing"` - additional properties that fail schema validation will be removed (where `additionalProperties` keyword is `false` or schema).
- _useDefaults_: replace missing or undefined properties and items with the values from corresponding `default` keywords. Default behaviour is to ignore `default` keywords. This option is not used if schema is added with `addMetaSchema` method. See examples in [Assigning defaults](#assigning-defaults). Option values:
  - `false` (default) - do not u
