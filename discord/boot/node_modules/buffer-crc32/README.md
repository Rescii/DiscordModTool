nspile with [nodent](https://github.com/MatAtBread/nodent) if async functions are not supported.
  - `true` - always transpile with nodent.
  - `false` - do not transpile; if async functions are not supported an exception will be thrown.


##### Advanced options

- _meta_: add [meta-schema](http://json-schema.org/documentation.html) so it can be used by other schemas (true by default). If an object is passed, it will be used as the default meta-schema for schemas that have no `$schema` keyword. This default meta-schema MUST have `$schema` keyword.
- _validateSchema_: validate added/compiled schemas against meta-schema (true by default). `$schema` property in the schema can be http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema or absent (draft-07 meta-schema will be used) or can be a reference to the schema previously added with `addMetaSchema` method. Option values:
  - `true` (default) -  if the validation fails, throw the exception.
  - `"log"` - if the validation fails, log error.
  - `false` - skip schema validation.
- _addUsedSchema_: by default methods `compile` and `validate` add schemas to the instance if they have `$id` (or `id`) property that doesn't start with "#". If `$id` is present and it is not unique the exception will be thrown. Set this option to `false` to skip adding schemas to the instance and the `$id` uniqueness check when these methods are used. This option does not affect `addSchema` method.
- _inlineRefs_: Affects compil
