This module solves this problem by providing `createReadStream` and
`createWriteStream` that operate on a shared file descriptor and provides
the convenient stream API while still allowing slicing and dicing.

This module also gives you some additional power that the builtin
`fs.createWriteStream` do not give you. These features are:

 * Emitting a 'progress' event on write.
 * Ability to set a maximum size and emit an error if this size is exceeded.
 * Ability to create an `FdSlicer` instance from a `Buffer`. This enables you
   to provide API for handling files as well as buffers using the same API.

## Usage

```js
var fdSlicer = require('fd-slicer');
var fs = require('fs');

fs.open("file.txt", 'r', function(err, fd) {
  if (err) throw err;
  var slicer = fdSlicer.createFromFd(fd);
  var firstPart = slicer.createReadStream({start: 0, end: 100});
  var secondPart = slicer.createReadStream({start: 100});
  var firstOut = fs.createWriteStream("first.txt");
  var secondOut = fs.createWriteStream("second.txt");
  firstPart.pipe(firstOut);
  secondPart.pipe(secondOut);
});
```

You can also create from a buffer:

```js
var fdSlicer = require('fd-slicer');
var slicer = FdSlicer.createFromBuffer(someBuffer);
var firstPart = slicer.createReadStream({start: 0, end: 100});
var secondPart = slicer.createReadStream({start: 100});
var firstOut = fs.createWriteStream("first.
