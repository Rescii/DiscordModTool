Neither of these are acceptable options. The first one is a severe bug,
because the API docs for `fs.write` state:

multiple write streams per file descriptor.

The second option suffers from a race condition. For each additional time the
file is opened after the first, it is possible that the file is modified. So
in our parallel uploading example, we might upload a corrupt file th
