6): an array of data instances. Ajv does not check the validity of these instances against the schema.
- `readOnly` and `writeOnly` (NEW in draft-07): marks data-instance as read-only or write-only in relation to the source of the data (database, api, etc.).
- `contentEncoding`: [RFC 2045](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045#section-6.1 ), e.g., "base64".
- `contentMediaType`: [RFC 2046](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2046), e.g., "image/png".

__Please note__:  Ajv does not implement validation of the keywords `examples`, `contentEncoding` and `contentMediaType` but it reserves them. If you want to create a plugin that implements some of them, it should remove these keywords from the instance.


## Formats

Ajv implements formats defined by JSON Schema specification and several other formats. It is recommended NOT to use "format" keyword implementations with untrusted data, as they use potentially unsafe regular expressions - see [ReDoS attack](#redos-attack).

__Please note__: if you need to use "format" keyword to validate untrusted data, you MUST assess their suitability and safety for your validation scenarios.

The following formats are implemented for string validation with "format" keyword:

- _date_: full-date according to [RFC3339](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6).
- _time_: time with optional time-zone.
- _date-time_: date-time from the same source (time-zone is mandatory). `date`, `time` and `date-time` validate ranges in `full` mode and only regexp in `fast` mode (see [options](#options)).
- _uri_: full URI.
- _uri-reference_: URI reference, including full and relative URIs.
- _uri-template_: URI template according to [RFC6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570)
- _url_ (deprecated): [URL record](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url).
- _email_: email address.
- _hostname_: host name according to [RFC1034](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1034#section-3.5).
- _ipv4_: IP address v4.
- _ipv6_: IP address v6.
- _regex_: tests whether a string is a valid regular expression by passing it to RegExp constructor.
- _uuid_: Universally Unique IDentifier according to [RFC4122](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122).
- _json-pointer_: JSON-pointer according to [RFC6901](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901).
- _relative-json-pointer_: relative JSON-pointer according to [this draft](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-luff-relative-json-pointer-00).

__Please note__: JSON Schema draft-07 also defines formats `iri`, `iri-reference`, `idn-hostname` and `idn-email` for URLs, hostnames and emails with international characters. Ajv does not implement these formats. If you create Ajv plugin that implements them please make a PR to mention this plugin here.

There are two modes of format validation: `fast` and `full`. This mode affects formats `date`, `time`, `date-time`, `uri`, `uri-reference`, and `email`. See [Options](#options) for details.

You can add additional formats and replace any of the formats above using [addFormat](#api-addformat) method.

The option `unknownFormats` allows changing the default behaviour when an unknown format is encountered. In this case Ajv can either fail schema compilation (default) or ignore it (default in versions before 5.0.0). You also can allow specific format(s) that will be ignored. See [Options](#options) for details.

You can find regular expressions used for format validation and the sources that were used in [formats.js](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/lib/compile/format
