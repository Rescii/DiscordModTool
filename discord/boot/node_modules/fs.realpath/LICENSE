 })
```

For example, to sort on the object key names in reverse order you could write:

``` js
var stringify = require('fast-json-stable-stringify');

var obj = { c: 8, b: [{z:6,y:5,x:4},7], a: 3 };
var s = stringify(obj, function (a, b) {
    return a.key < b.key ? 1 : -1;
});
console.log(s);
```

which results in the output string:

```
{"c":8,"b":[{"z":6,"y":5,"x":4},7],"a":3}
```

Or if you wanted to sort on the object values in reverse order, you could write:

```
var stringify = require('fast-json-stable-stringify');

var obj = { d: 6, c: 5, b: [{z:3,y:2,x:1},9], a: 10 };
var s = stringify(obj, function (a, b) {
    return a.value < b.value ? 1 : -1;
});
console.log(s);
```

which outputs:

```
{"d":6,"c":5,"b":[{"z":3,"y":2,"x":1},9],"a":10}
```

### cycles

Pass `true` in `opts.cycles` to stringify circular property as `__cycle__` - the result will not be a valid JSON string in this case.

TypeError will be thrown in case of circular object without this option.
