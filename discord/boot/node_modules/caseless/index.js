ation of referenced schemas. Option values:
  - `true` (default) - the referenced schemas that don't have refs in them are inlined, regardless of their size - that substantially improves performance at the cost of the bigger size of compiled schema functions.
  - `false` - to not inline referenced schemas (they will be compiled as separate functions).
  - integer number - to limit the maximum number of keywords of the schema that will be inlined.
- _passContext_: pass validation context to custom keyword functions. If this option is `true` and you pass some context to the compiled validation function with `validate.call(context, data)`, the `context` will be available as `this` in your custom keywords. By default `this` is Ajv instance.
- _loopRequired_: by default `required` keyword is compiled into a single expression (or a sequence of statements in `allErrors` mode). In case of a very large number of properties in this keyword it may result in a very big validation function. Pass integer to set the number of properties above which `required` keyword will be validated in a loop - smaller validation function size but also worse performance.
- _ownProperties_: by default Ajv iterates over all enumerable object properties; when this option is `true` only own enumerable object properties (i.e. found directly on the object rather than on its prototype) are iterated. Contributed by @mbroadst.
- _multipleOfPrecision_: by default `multipleOf` keyword is validated by comparing the result of division with parseInt() of that result. It works for dividers that are bigger than 1. For small dividers such as 0.01 the result of the division is usually not integer (even when it should be integer, see issue [#84](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/issues/84)). If you ne
