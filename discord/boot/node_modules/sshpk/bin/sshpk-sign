equal to the value of
`require('buffer').kMaxLength` (on 64-bit architectures, `kMaxLength` is
`(2^31)-1`). Otherwise, a [`RangeError`][] is thrown. A zero-length Buffer will
be created if a `size` less than or equal to 0 is specified.

If `fill` is specified, the allocated `Buffer` will be initialized by calling
`buf.fill(fill)`. See [`buf.fill()`][] for more information.

```js
const buf = Buffer.alloc(5, 'a');
console.log(buf);
  // <Buffer 61 61 61 61 61>
```

If both `fill` and `encoding` are specified, the allocated `Buffer` will be
initialized by calling `buf.fill(fill, encoding)`. For example:

```js
const buf = Buffer.alloc(11, 'aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ=', 'base64');
console.log(buf);
  // <Buffer 68 65 6c 6c 6f 20 77 6f 72 6c 64>
```

Calling `Buffer.alloc(size)` can be significantly slower than the alternative
`Buffer.allocUnsafe(size)` but ensures that the newly created `Buffer` instance
contents will *never contain sensitive data*.

A `TypeError` will be thrown if `size` is not a number.

### Class Method: Buffer.allocUnsafe(size)
<!-- YAML

* `size` {Number}

Allocates a new *non-zero-filled* `Buffer` of `size` bytes.  The `size` must
be less than or equal to the value of `require('buffer').kMaxLength` (on 64-bit
architectures, `kMaxLength` is `(2^31)-1`). Otherwise, a [`RangeError`][] is
thrown. A zero-length Buffer will be created if a `size` less than or equal to
0 is specified.

The underlying memory for `Buffer` instances created in this way is *not
initialized*. The contents of the newly created `Buffer` are unknown and
*may contain sensitive data*. Use [`buf.fill(0)`][] to initialize such
`Buffer` instances to zeroes.

```js
const buf = Buffer.allocUnsafe(5);
console.log(buf);
  // <Buffer 78 e0 82 02 01>
  // (octets will be different, every time)
buf.fill(0);
console.log(buf);
  // <Buffer 00 00 00 00 00>
```

A `TypeError` will be thrown if `size` is not a number.

Note that the `Buffer` module pre-allocates an internal `Buffer` instance of
size `Buffer.poolSize` that is used as a pool for the fast allocation of new
`Buffer` instances created using `Buffer.allocUnsafe(size)` (and the deprecated
`new Buffer(size)` constructor) only when `size` is less than or equal to
`Buffer.poolSize >> 1` (floor of `Buffer.poolSize` divided by two). The default
value of `Buffer.poolSize` is `8192` but can be modified.

Use of this pre-allocated internal memory pool is a key difference between
calling `Buffer.alloc(size, fill)` vs. `Buffer.allocUnsafe(size).fill(fill)`.
Specifically, `Buffer.alloc(size, fill)` will *never* use the internal Buffer
pool, while `Buffer.allocUnsafe(size).fill(fill)` *will* use the internal
Buffer pool if `size` is less than or equal to half `Buffer.poolSize`. The
difference is subtle but can be important when an application requires the
additional performance that `Buffer.allocUnsafe(size)` provides.

### Class Method: Buffer.allocUnsafeSlow(size)
<!-- YAML

* `size` {Number}

Allocates a new *non-zero-filled* and non-pooled `Buffer` of `size` bytes.  The
`size` must be less than or equal to the value of
`require('buffer').kMaxLength` (on 64-bit architectures, `kMaxLength` is
`(2^31)-1`). Otherwise, a [`RangeError`][] is thrown. A zero-length Buffer will
be created if a `size` less than or equal to 0 is specified.

The underlying memory for `Buffer` instances created in this way is *not
initialized*. The contents of the newly created `Buffer` are unknown and
*may contain sensitive data*. Use [`buf.fill(0)`][] to initialize such
`Buffer` instances to zeroes.

When using `Buffer.allocUnsafe()` to allocate new `Buffer` instances,
allocations under 4KB are, by default, sliced from a single pre-allocated
`Buffer`. This allows applications to avoid the garbage collection overhead of
creating many individually allocated Buffers. This approach improves both
performance and memory usage by eliminating the need to track and cleanup as
many `Persistent` objects.

However, in the case
