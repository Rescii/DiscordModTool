If you are using a tunneling proxy, you may set the
`proxyHeaderWhiteList` to share certain headers with the proxy.

You can also set the `proxyHeaderExclusiveList` to share certain
headers only with the proxy and not with destination host.

By default, this set is:

```
accept
accept-charset
accept-encoding
accept-language
accept-ranges
cache-control
content-encoding
content-language
content-length
content-location
content-md5
content-range
content-type
connection
date
expect
max-forwards
pragma
proxy-authorization
referer
te
transfer-encoding
user-agent
via
```

Note that, when using a tunneling proxy, the `proxy-authorization`
header and any headers from custom `proxyHeaderExclusiveList` are
*never* sent to the endpoint server, but only to the proxy server.


### Controlling proxy behaviour using environment variables

The following environment variables are respected by `request`:

 * `HTTP_PROXY` / `http_proxy`
 * `HTTPS_PROXY` / `https_proxy`
 * `NO_PROXY` / `no_proxy`

When `HTTP_PROXY` / `http_proxy` are set, they will be used to proxy non-SSL requests that do not have an explicit `proxy` configuration option present. Similarly, `HTTPS_PROXY` / `https_proxy` will be respected for SSL requests that do not have an explicit `proxy` configuration option. It is valid to define a proxy in one of the environment variables, but then override it for a specific request, using the `proxy` configuration option. Furthermore, the `proxy` configuration option can be explicitly set to false / null to opt out of proxying altogether for that request.

`request` is also aware of the `NO_PROXY`/`no_proxy` environment variables. These variables provide a granular way to opt out of proxying, on a per-host basis. It should contain a comma separated list of hosts to opt out of proxying. It is also possible to opt of proxying when a particular destination port is used. Finally, the variable may be set to `*` to opt out of the implicit proxy configuration of the other environment variables.

Here's some examples of valid `no_proxy` values:

 * `google.com` - don't proxy HTTP/HTTPS requests to Google.
 * `google.com:443` - don't proxy HTTPS requests to Google, but *do* proxy HTTP requests to Google.
 * `google.com:443, yahoo.com:80` - don't proxy HTTPS requests to Google, and don't proxy HTTP
