 containing values `user` || `username`, `pass` || `password`, and `sendImmediately` (optional). See documentation above.
- `oauth` - options for OAuth HMAC-SHA1 signing. See documentation above.
- `hawk` - options for [Hawk signing](https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk). The `credentials` key must contain the necessary signing info, [see hawk docs for details](https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk#usage-example).
- `aws` - `object` containing AWS signing information. Should have the properties `key`, `secret`, and optionally `session` (note that this only works for services that require session as part of the canonical string). Also requires the property `bucket`, unless you’re specifying your `bucket` as part of the path, or the request doesn’t use a bucket (i.e. GET Services). If you want to use AWS sign version 4 use the parameter `sign_version` with value `4` otherwise the default is version 2. If you are using SigV4, you can also include a `service` property that specifies the service name. **Note:** you need to `npm install aws4` first.
- `httpSignature` - options for the [HTTP Signature Scheme](https://github.com/joyent/node-http-signature/blob/master/http_signing.md) using [Joyent's library](https://github.com/joyent/node-http-signature). The `keyId` and `key` properties must be specified. See the docs for other options.

- `followRedirect` - follow HTTP 3xx responses as redirects (default: `true`). This property can also be implemented as function which gets `response` object as a single argument and should return `true` if redirects should continue or `false` otherwise.
- `followAllRedirects` - follow non-GET HTTP 3xx responses as redirects (default: `false`)
- `followOriginalHttpMethod` - by default we redirect to HTTP method GET. you can enable this property to redirect to the original HTTP method (default: `false`)
- `maxRedirects` - the maximum number of redirects to follow (default: `10`)
- `removeRefererHeader` - removes the referer header when a redirect happens (default: `false`). **Note:** if true, referer header set in the initial request is preserved during redirect chain.

- `encoding` - encoding to be used on `setEncoding` of response data. If `null`, the `body` is returned as a `Buffer`. Anything else **(including the default value of `undefined`)** will be passed as the [encoding](http://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_buffer) parameter to `toString()` (meaning this is effectively `utf8` by default). (**Note:** if you expect binary data, you should set `encoding: null`.)
- `gzip` - if `true`, add an `Accept-Encoding` header to request compressed content encodings from the server (if not already present) and decode supported content encodings in the response. **Note:** Automatic decoding of the response content is performed on the body data returned through `request` (both through the `request` stream and passed to the callback function) but is not performed on the `response` stream (available from the `response` event) which is the unmodified `http.IncomingMessage` object which may contain compressed data. See example below.
- `jar` - if `true`, remember cookies for future use (or define your custom cookie jar; see examples section)

---

- `agent` - `http(s).Agent` instance to use
- `agentClass` - alternatively specify your agent's class name
- `agentOptions` - and pass its options. **Note:** for HTTPS see [tls API doc for TLS/SSL opt
