 },
    "str": { "type": "string" }
  }
};
```

Now to compile your schema you can either pass all schemas to Ajv instance:

```javascript
var ajv = new Ajv({schemas: [schema, defsSchema]});
var validate = ajv.getSchema('http://example.com/schemas/schema.json');
```

or use `addSchema` method:

```javascript
var ajv = new Ajv;
var validate = ajv.addSchema(defsSchema)
                  .compile(schema);
```

See [Options](#options) and [addSchema](#api) method.

__Please note__:
- `$ref` is resolved as the uri-reference using schema $id as the base URI (see the example).
- References can be recursive (and mutually recursive) to implement the schemas for different data structures (such as linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.).
- You don't have to host your schema files at the URIs that you use as schema $id. These URIs are only used to identify the schemas, and according to JSON Schema specification validators should not expect to be able to download the schemas from these URIs.
- The actual location of the schema file in the file system is not used.
- You can pass the identifier of the schema as the second parameter of `addSchema` method or as a property name in `schemas` option. This identifier can be used instead of (or in addition to) schema $id.
- You cannot have the same $id (or the schema identifier) used for more than one schema - the exception will be thrown.
- You can implement dynamic resolution of the referenced schemas using `compileAsync` method. In this way you can store schemas in any system (files, web, database, etc.) and reference them without explicitly adding to Ajv instance. See [Asynchronous schema compilation](#asynchronous-schema-compilation).


## $data reference

With `$data` option you can use values from the validated data as the values for the schema keywords. See [proposal](https://github.com/json-schema-org/json-schema-spec/issues/51) for more information about how it works.

`$data` reference is supported in the keywords: const, enum, format, maximum/minimum, exclusiveMaximum / exclusiveMinimum, maxLength / minLength, maxItems / minItems, maxProperties / minProperties, formatMaximum / formatMinimum, formatExclusiveMaximum / formatExclusiveMinimum, multipleOf, pattern, required, uniqueItems.

The value of "$data" should be a [JSON-pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) to the data (the root is always the top level data object, even if the $data reference is inside a referenced subschema) or a [relative JSON-pointer](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-luff-relative-json-pointer-00) (it is relative to the current point in data; if the $data reference is inside a referenced subschema it cannot point to the data outside of the root level for this subschema).

Examples.

This schema requires that the value in property `smaller` is less or equal than the value in the property larger:

```javascript
var ajv = new Ajv({$data: true});

var schema = {
  "properties": {
    "smaller": {
      "type": "number",
      "maximum": { "$data": "1/larger" }
    },
    "larger": { "type": "number" }
  }
};

var validData = {
  smaller: 5,
  larger: 7
};

ajv.validate(schema, validData); // true
```

This schema requires that the properties have the same format as their field names:

```javascript
var schema = {
  "additionalProperties": {
    "type": "string",
    "format": { "$data": "0#" }
  }
};

var validData = {
  'date-time': '1963-06-19T08:30:06.283185Z',
  email: 'joe.bloggs@example.com'
}
```

`$data` reference is resolved safely - it won't throw even if some property is undefined. If `$data` resolves to `undefined` the validation succeeds (with the exclusion of `const` keyword). If `$data` resolves to incorrect type (e.g. not "number" for maximum keyword) the validation fails.


## $merge and $patch keywords

With the package [ajv-merge-patch](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-merge-patch) you can use the keywords `$merge` and `$patch` that allow extending JSON Schemas with patches using formats [JSON Merge Patch (RFC 7396)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396) and [JSON Patch (RFC 6902)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902).

To add keywords `$merge` and `$patch` to Ajv instance use this code:

```javascript
require('ajv-merge-patch')(ajv);
```

Examples.

Using `$merge`:

```json
{
  "$merge": {
    "source": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": { "p": { "type": "string" } },
      "additionalProperties": false
    },
    "with": {
      "properties": { "q": { "type": "number" } }
    }
  }
}
```

Using `$patch`:

```json
{
  "$patch": {
    "source": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": { "p": { "type": "string" } },
      "additionalProperties": false
    },
    "with": [
      { "op": "add", "path": "/properties/q", "value": { "type": "number" } }
    ]
  }
}
```

The schemas above are equivalent to this schema:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "p": { "type": "string" },
    "q": { "type": "number" }
  },
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

The properties `source` and `with` in the keywords `$merge` and `$patch` can use absolute or relative `$ref` to point to other schemas previously added to the Ajv instance or to the fragments of the current schema.

See the package [ajv-merge-patch](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-merge-patch) for more information.


## Defining custom keywords

The advantages of using custom keywords are:

- allow creating validation scenarios that cannot be expressed using JSON Schema
- simplify your schemas
- help bringing a bigger part of the validation logic to your schemas
- make your schemas more expressive, less verbose and closer to your application domain
- implement custom data processors that modify your data (`modifying` option MUST be used in keyword definition) and/or create side effects while the data is being validated

If a keyword is used only for side-effects and its validation result is pre-defined, use option `valid: true/false` in keyword definition to simplify both generated code (no error handling in case of `valid: true`) and your keyword functions (no need to return any validation result).

The concerns you have to be aware of when extending JSON Schema standard with custom keywords are the portability and understanding of your schemas. You will have to support these custom keywords on other platforms and to properly document these keywords so that everybody can understand them in your schemas.

You can define custom keywords with [addKeyword](#api-addkeyword) method. Keywords are defined on the `ajv` instance level - new instances will not have previously defined keywords.

Ajv allows defining keywords with:
- validation function
- compilation function
- macro function
- inline compilation function that should return code (as string) that will be inlined in the currently compiled schema.

Example. `range` and `exclusiveRange` keywords using compiled schema:

```javascript
ajv.addKeyword('range', {
  type: 'number',
  compile: function (sch, parentSchema) {
    var min = sch[0];
    var max = sch[1];

    return parentSchema.exclusiveRange === true
            ? function (data) { return data > min && data < max; }
            : function (data) { return data >= min && data <= max; }
  }
});

var schema = { "range": [2, 4], "exclusiveRange": true };
var validate = ajv.compile(schema);
console.log(validate(2.01)); // true
console.log(validate(3.99)); // true
console.log(validate(2)); // false
console.log(validate(4)); // false
```

Several custom keywords (typeof, instanceof, range and propertyNames) are defined in [ajv-keywords](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-keywords) package - they can be used for your schemas and as a starting point for your own custom keywords.

See [Defining custom keywords](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/CUSTOM.md) for more details.


## Asynchronous schema compilation

During asynchronous compilation remote references are loaded using supplied function. See `compileAsync` [method](#api-compileAsync) and `loadSchema` [option](#options).

Example:

```javascript
var ajv = new Ajv({ loadSchema: loadSchema });

ajv.compileAsync(schema).then(function (validate) {
  var valid = validate(data);
  // ...
});

function loadSchema(uri) {
  return request.json(uri).then(function (res) {
    if (res.statusCode >= 400)
      throw new Error('Loading error: ' + res.statusCode);
    return res.body;
  });
}
```

__Please note__: [Option](#options) `missingRefs` should NOT be set to `"ignore"` or `"fail"` for asynchronous compilation to work.


## Asynchronous validation

Example in Node.js REPL: https://tonicdev.com/esp/ajv-asynchronous-validation

You can define custom formats and keywords that perform validation asynchronously by accessing database or some other service. You should add `async: true` in the keyword or format definition (see [addFormat](#api-addformat), [addKeyword](#api-addkeyword) and [Defining custom keywords](#defining-custom-keywords)).

If your schema uses asynchronous formats/keywords or refers to some schema that contains them it should have `"$async": true` keyword so that Ajv can compile it correctly. If asynchronous format/keyword or reference to asynchronous schema is used in the schema without `$async` keyword Ajv will throw an exception during schema compilation.

__Please note__: all asynchronous subschemas that are referenced from the current or other schemas should have `"$async": true` keyword as well, otherwise the schema compilation will fail.

Validation function for an asynchronous custom format/keyword should return a promise that resolves with `true` or `false` (or rejects with `new Ajv.ValidationError(errors)` if you want to return custom errors from the keyword function).

Ajv compiles asynchronous schemas to [es7 async functions](http://tc39.github.io/ecmascript-asyncawait/) that can optionally be transpiled with [nodent](https://github.com/MatAtBread/nodent). Async functions are supported in Node.js 7+ and all modern browsers. You can also supply any other transpiler as a function via `processCode` option. See [Options](#options).

The compiled validation function has `$async: true` property (if the schema is asynchronous), so you can differentiate these functions if you are using both synchronous and asynchronous schemas.

Validation result will be a promise that resolves with validated data or rejects with an exception `Ajv.ValidationError` that contains the array of validation errors in `errors` property.


Example:

```javascript
var ajv = new Ajv;
// require('ajv-async')(ajv);

ajv.addKeyword('idExists', {
  async: true,
  type: 'number',
  validate: checkIdExists
});


function checkIdExists(schema, data) {
  return knex(schema.table)
  .select('id')
  .where('id', data)
  .then(function (rows) {
    return !!rows.length; // true if record is found
  });
}

var schema = {
  "$async": true,
  "properties": {
    "userId": {
      "type": "integer",
      "idExists": { "table": "users" }
    },
    "postId": {
      "type": "integer",
      "idExists": { "table": "posts" }
    }
  }
};

var validate = ajv.compile(schema);

validate({ userId: 1, postId: 19 })
.then(function (data) {
  console.log('Data is valid', data); // { userId: 1, postId: 19 }
})
.catch(function (err) {
  if (!(err instanceof Ajv.ValidationError)) throw err;
  // data is invalid
  console.log('Validation errors:', err.errors);
});
```

### Using transpilers with asynchronous validation functions.

[ajv-async](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-async) uses [nodent](https://github.com/MatAtBread/nodent) to transpile async functions. To use another transpiler you should separately install it (or load its bundle in the browser).


#### Using nodent

```javascript
var ajv = new Ajv;
require('ajv-async')(ajv);
// in the browser if you want to load ajv-async bundle separately you can:
// window.ajvAsync(ajv);
var validate = ajv.compile(schema); // transpiled es7 async function
validate(data).then(successFunc).catch(errorFunc);
```


#### Using other transpilers

```javascript
var ajv = new Ajv({ processCode: transpileFunc });
var validate = ajv.compile(schema); // transpiled es7 async function
validate(data).then(successFunc).catch(errorFunc);
```

See [Options](#options).


## Security considerations

JSON Schema, if properly used, can replace data sanitisation. It doesn't replace other API security considerations. It also introduces additional security aspects to consider.


##### Security contact

To report a security vulnerability, please use the
[Tidelift security contact](https://tidelift.com/security).
Tidelift will coordinate the fix and disclosure. Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities via GitHub issues.


##### Untrusted schemas

Ajv treats JSON schemas as trusted as your application code. This security model is based on the most common use case, when the schemas are static and bundled together with the application.

If your schemas are received from untrusted sources (or generated from untrusted data) there are several scenarios you need to prevent:
- compiling schemas can cause stack overflow (if they are too deep)
- compiling schemas can be slow (e.g. [#557](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/issues/557))
- validating certain data can be slow

It is difficult to predict all the scenarios, but at the very least it may help to limit the size of untrusted schemas (e.g. limit JSON string length) and also the maximum schema object depth (that can be high for relatively small JSON strings). You also may want to mitigate slow regular expressions in `pattern` and `patternProperties` keywords.

Regardless the measures you take, using untrusted schemas increases security risks.


##### Circular references in JavaScript objects

Ajv does not support schemas and validated data that have circular references in objects. See [issue #802](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/issues/802).

An attempt to compile such schemas or validate such data would cause stack overflow (or will not complete in case of asynchronous validation). Depending on the parser you use, untrusted data can lead to circular references.


##### Security risks of trusted schemas

Some keywords in JSON Schemas can lead to very slow validation for certain data. These keywords include (but may be not limited to):

- `pattern` and `format` for large strings - in some cases using `maxLength` can help mitigate it, but certain regular expressions can lead to exponential validation time even with relatively short strings (see [ReDoS attack](#redos-attack)).
- `patternProperties` for large property names - use `propertyNames` to mitigate, but some regular expressions can have exponential evaluation time as well.
- `uniqueItems` for large non-scalar arrays - use `maxItems` to mitigate

__Please note__: The suggestions above to prevent slow validation would only work if you do NOT use `allErrors: true` in production code (using it would continue validation after validation errors).

You can validate your JSON schemas against [this meta-schema](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/lib/refs/json-schema-secure.json) to check that these recommendations are followed:

```javascript
const isSchemaSecure = ajv.compile(require('ajv/lib/refs/json-schema-secure.json'));

const schema1 = {format: 'email'};
isSchemaSecure(schema1); // false

const schema2 = {format: 'email', maxLength: MAX_LENGTH};
isSchemaSecure(schema2); // true
```

__Please note__: following all these recommendation is not a guarantee that validation of untrusted data is safe - it can still lead to some undesirable results.


##### Content Security Policies (CSP)
See [Ajv and Content Security Policies (CSP)](#ajv-and-content-security-policies-csp)


## ReDoS attack

Certain regular expressions can lead to the exponential evaluation time even with relatively short strings.

Please assess the regular expressions you use in the schemas on their vulnerability to this attack - see [safe-regex](https://github.com/substack/safe-regex), for example.

__Please note__: some formats that Ajv implements use [regular expressions](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/lib/compile/formats.js) that can be vulnerable to ReDoS attack, so if you use Ajv to validate data from untrusted sources __it is strongly recommended__ to consider the following:

- making assessment of "format" implementations in Ajv.
- using `format: 'fast'` option that simplifies some of the regular expressions (although it does not guarantee that they are safe).
- replacing format implementations provided by Ajv with your own implementations of "format" keyword that either uses different regular expressions or another approach to format validation. Please see [addFormat](#api-addformat) method.
- disabling format validation by ignoring "format" keyword with option `format: false`

Whatever mitigation you choose, please assume all formats provided by Ajv as potentially unsafe and make your own assessment of their suitability for your validation scenarios.


## Filtering data

With [option `removeAdditional`](#options) (added by [andyscott](https://github.com/andyscott)) you can filter data during the validation.

This option modifies original data.

Example:

```javascript
var ajv = new Ajv({ removeAdditional: true });
var schema = {
  "additionalProperties": false,
  "properties": {
    "foo": { "type": "number" },
    "bar": {
      "additionalProperties": { "type": "number" },
      "properties": {
        "baz": { "type": "string" }
      }
    }
  }
}

var data = {
  "foo": 0,
  "additional1": 1, // will be removed; `additionalProperties` == false
  "bar": {
    "baz": "abc",
    "additional2": 2 // will NOT be removed; `additionalProperties` != false
  },
}

var validate = ajv.compile(schema);

console.log(validate(data)); // true
console.log(data); // { "foo": 0, "bar": { "baz": "abc", "additional2": 2 }
```

If `removeAdditional` option in the example above were `"all"` then both `additional1` and `additional2` properties would have been removed.

If the option were `"failing"` then property `additional1` would have been removed regardless of its value and property `additional2` would have been removed only if its value were failing the schema in the inner `additionalProperties` (so in the example above it would have stayed because it passes the schema, but any non-number would have been removed).

__Please note__: If you use `removeAdditional` option with `additionalProperties` keyword inside `anyOf`/`oneOf` keywords your validation can fail with this schema, for example:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "oneOf": [
    {
      "properties": {
        "foo": { "type": "string" }
      },
      "required": [ "foo" ],
      "additionalProperties": false
    },
    {
      "properties": {
        "bar": { "type": "integer" }
      },
      "required": [ "bar" ],
      "additionalProperties": false
    }
  ]
}
```

The intention of the schema above is to allow objects with either the string property "foo" or the integer property "bar", but not with both and not with any other properties.

With the option `removeAdditional: true` the validation will pass for the object `{ "foo": "abc"}` but will fail for the object `{"bar": 1}`. It happens because while the first subschema in `oneOf` is validated, the property `bar` is removed because it is an additional property according to the standard (because it is not included in `properties` keyword in the same schema).

While this behaviour is unexpected (issues [#129](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/issues/129), [#134](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/issues/134)), it is correct. To have the expected behaviour (both objects are allowed and additional properties are removed) the schema has to be refactored in this way:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "foo": { "type": "string" },
    "bar": { "type": "integer" }
  },
  "additionalProperties": false,
  "oneOf": [
    { "required": [ "foo" ] },
    { "required": [ "bar" ] }
  ]
}
```

The schema above is also more efficient - it will compile into a faster function.


## Assigning defaults

With [option `useDefaults`](#options) Ajv will assign values from `default` keyword in the schemas of `properties` and `items` (when it is the array of schemas) to the missing properties and items.

With the option value `"empty"` properties and items equal to `null` or `""` (empty string) will be considered missing and assigned defaults.

This option modifies original data.

__Please note__: the default value is inserted in the generated validation code as a literal, so the value inserted in the data will be the deep clone of the default in the schema.


Example 1 (`default` in `properties`):

```javascript
var ajv = new Ajv({ useDefaults: true });
var schema = {
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "foo": { "type": "number" },
    "bar": { "type": "string", "default": "baz" }
  },
  "required": [ "foo", "bar" ]
};

var data = { "foo": 1 };

var validate = ajv.compile(schema);

console.log(validate(data)); // true
console.log(data); // { "foo": 1, "bar": "baz" }
```

Example 2 (`default` in `items`):

```javascript
var schema = {
  "type": "array",
  "items": [
    { "type": "number" },
    { "type": "string", "default": "foo" }
  ]
}

var data = [ 1 ];

var validate = ajv.compile(schema);

console.log(validate(data)); // true
console.log(data); // [ 1, "foo" ]
```

`default` keywords in other cases are ignored:

- not in `properties` or `items` subschemas
- in schemas inside `anyOf`, `oneOf` and `not` (see [#42](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/issues/42))
- in `if` subschema of `switch` keyword
- in schemas generated by custom macro keywords

The [`strictDefaults` option](#options) customizes Ajv's behavior for the defaults that Ajv ignores (`true` raises an error, and `"log"` outputs a warning).


## Coercing data types

When you are validating user inputs all your data properties are usually strings. The option `coerceTypes` allows you to have your data types coerced to the types specified in your schema `type` keywords, both to pass the validation and to use the correctly typed data afterwards.

This option modifies original data.

__Please note__: if you pass a scalar value to the validating function its type will be coerced and it will pass the validation, but the value of the variable you pass won't be updated because scalars are passed by value.


Example 1:

```javascript
var ajv = new Ajv({ coerceTypes: true });
var schema = {
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "foo": { "type": "number" },
    "bar": { "type": "boolean" }
  },
  "required": [ "foo", "bar" ]
};

var data = { "foo": "1", "bar": "false" };

var validate = ajv.compile(schema);

console.log(validate(data)); // true
console.log(data); // { "foo": 1, "bar": false }
```

Example 2 (array coercions):

```javascript
var ajv = new Ajv({ coerceTypes: 'array' });
var schema = {
  "properties": {
    "foo": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "number" } },
    "bar": { "type": "boolean" }
  }
};

var data = { "foo": "1", "bar": ["false"] };

var validate = ajv.compile(schema);

console.log(validate(data)); // true
console.l
