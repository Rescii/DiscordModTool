 (String). Optional. This is used for [Bash
  completion](#bash-completion) for an option argument. If not specified,
  then the value of `type` is used. Any string may be specified, but only the
  following values have meaning:

    - `none`: Provide no completions.
    - `file`: Bash's default completion (i.e. `complete -o default`), which
      includes filenames.
    - *Any string FOO for which a `function complete_FOO` Bash function is
      defined.* This is for custom completions for a given tool. Typically
      these custom functions are provided in the `specExtra` argument to
      `dashdash.bashCompletionFromOptions()`. See
      ["examples/ddcompletion.js"](examples/ddcompletion.js) for an example.

- `env` (String or Array of String). Optional. An environment variable name
  (or names) that can be used as a fallback for this option. For example,
  given a "foo.js" like this:

        var options = [{names: ['dry-run', 'n'], env: 'FOO_DRY_RUN'}];
        var opts = dashdash.parse({options: options});

  Both `node foo.js --dry-ru
