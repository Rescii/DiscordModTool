h only a `group` property -- the string to print as
the heading for the subsequent options in the array.  For example:

```javascript
var options = [
    {
        group: 'Armament Options'
    },
    {
        names: [ 'weapon', 'w' ],
        type: 'string'
    },
    {
        group: 'General Options'
    },
    {
        names: [ 'help', 'h' ],
        type: 'bool'
    }
];
...
```

Note: You can use an empty string, `{group: ''}`, to get a blank line in help
output between groups of options.


# Help config

The `parser.help(...)` function is configurable as follows:

        Options:
          Armament Options:
        ^^  -w WEAPON, --weapon=WEAPON  Weapon with which to crush. One of: |
       /                                sword, spear, maul                  |
      /   General Options:                                                  |
     /      -h, --help                  Print this help and exit.           |
    /   ^^^^                            ^                                   |
    \       `-- indent                   `-- helpCol              maxCol ---'
     `-- headingIndent

- `indent` (Number or String). Default 4. Set to a number (for that many
  spaces) or a string for the literal indent.
- `headingIndent` (Number or String). Default half length of `indent`. Set to
  a number (for that many spaces) or a string for the literal indent. This
  indent applies to group heading lines, between normal option lines.
- `nameSort` (String). Default is 'length'. By default the names are
  sorted to put the short opts first (i.e. '-h, --help' preferred
  to '--help, -h'). Set to 'none' to not do this sorting.
- `maxCol` (Number). Default 80. Note that reflow is just done on whitespace
  so a long token in the option help can overflow maxCol.
- `helpCol` (Number). If not set a reasonable value will be determined
  between `minHelpCol` and `maxHelpCol`.
- `minHelpCol` (Number). Default 20.
- `maxHelpCol` (Number). Default 40.
- `helpWrap` (Boolean). Default true. Set to `false` to have option `help`
  strings *not* be textwrapped to the helpCol..maxCol range.
- `includeEnv` (Boolean). Default false. If the option has associated
  environment variables (via the `env` option spec attribute), then
  append mentioned of those envvars to the help string.
- `includeDefault` (Boolean). Default false. If the option has a default value
  (via the `default` option spec attribute, or a default on the option's type),
  then a "Default: VALUE" string will be appended to the help string.


# Custom option types

Dashdash includes a good starter set of option types that it will parse for
you. However, you can add your own via:

    var dashdash = require('dashdash');
    dashdash.addOptionType({
        name: '...',
        takesArg: true,
        helpArg: '...',
        parseArg: function (option, optstr, arg) {
            ...
        },
        array: false,  // optional
        arrayFlatten: false,  // optional
        default: ...,   // optional
        completionType: ...  // optional
    });

For example, a simple option type that accepts 'yes', 'y', 'no' or 'n' as
a boolean argument would look like:

    var dashdash = require('dashdash');

    function parseYesNo(option, optstr, arg) {
        var argLower = arg.toLowerCase()
        if (~['yes', 'y'].indexOf(argLower)) {
            return true;
        } else if (~['no', 'n'].indexOf(argLower)) {
            return false;
        } else {
            throw new Error(format(
                'arg for "%s" is not "yes" or "no": "%s"',
                optstr, arg));
        }
    }

    dashdash.addOptionType({
        name: 'yesno'
        takesArg: true,
        helpArg: '<yes|no>',
        parseArg: parseYesNo
    });

    var options = {
        {names: ['answer', 'a'], type: 'yesno'}
    };
    var opts = dashdash.parse({options: options});

See "examples/custom-option-\*.js" for other examples.
See the `addOptionType` block comment in "lib/dashdash.js" for more details.
Please let me know [with an
issue](https://github.com/trentm/node-dashdash/issues/new) if you write a
generally useful one.



# Why

Why another node.js option parsing lib?

- `nopt` really is just for "tools like npm". Implicit opts (e.g. '--no-foo'
  works for every '--foo'). Can't disable abbreviated opts. Can't do multiple
  usages of same opt, e.g. '-vvv' (I think). Can't do grouped short opts.

- `optimist` has surprise interpretation of options (at least to me).
  Implicit opts mean ambiguities and poor error handling for fat-fingering.
  `process.exit` calls makes it hard to use as a libary.

- `optparse` Incomplete docs. Is this an attempted clone of Python's `optparse`.
  Not clear. Some divergence. `parser.on("name", ...)` API is weird.

- `argparse` Dep on underscore. No thanks just for option processing.
  `find lib | wc -l` -> `26`. Overkill.
  Argparse is a bit different anyway. Not sure I want that.

- `posix-getopt` No type validation. Though that isn't a killer. AFAIK can't
  have a long opt without a short alias. I.e. no `getopt_long` semantics.
  Also, no whizbang features like generated help output.

- ["commander.js"](https://github.com/visionmedia/commander.js): I wrote
  [a critique](http://trentm.com/2014/01/a-critique-of-commander-for-nodejs.html)
  a while back. It seems fine, but last I checked had
  [an outstanding bug](https://github.com/visionmedia/commander.js/pull/121)
  that would prevent me from using it.
