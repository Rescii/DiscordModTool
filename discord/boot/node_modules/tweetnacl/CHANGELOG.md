 `name` -- a String
 - `asArray` -- an optional Boolean

### `Identity#toArray()`

Returns the Identity as an Array of DN component objects. This looks like:

```js
[ {
  "name": "cn",
  "value": "Joe Bloggs"
},
{
  "name": "o",
  "value": "Organisation Ltd"
} ]
```

Each object has a `name` and a `value` property. The returned objects may be
safely modified.

Errors
------

### `InvalidAlgorithmError`

The specified algorithm is not valid, either because it is not supported, or
because it was not included on a list of allowed algorithms.

Thrown by `Fingerprint.parse`, `Key#fingerprint`.

Properties

- `algorithm` -- the algorithm that could not be validated

### `FingerprintFormatError`

The fingerprint string given could not be parsed as a supported fingerprint
format, or the specified fingerprint format is invalid.

Thrown by `Fingerprint.parse`, `Fingerprint#toString`.

Properties

- `fingerprint` -- if caused by a fingerprint, the string value given
- `format` -- if caused by an invalid format specification, the string value given

### `KeyParseError`

The key data given could not be parsed as a valid key.

Properties

- `keyName` -- `filename` that was given to `parseKey`
- `format` -- the `format` that was trying to parse the key (see `parseKey`)
- `innerErr` -- the inner Error thrown by the format parser

### `KeyEncryptedError`

The key is encrypted with a symmetric key (ie, it is password protected). The
parsing operation would succeed if it was given the `passphrase` option.

Properties

- `keyName` -- `filename` that was given to `parseKey`
- `format` -- the `format` that was trying to parse the key (currently can only
              be `"pem"`)

### `CertificateParseError`

The certificate data given could not be parsed as a valid certificate.

Properties

- `certName` -- `filename` that was given to `parseCertificate`
- `format` -- the `format` that was trying to parse the key
              (see `parseCertificate`)
- `innerErr` -- the inner Error thrown by the format parser
