> data.** Use `buf.fill(0)` to initialize a Buffer to zeroes.

(Emphasis our own.)

Whenever the programmer intended to create an uninitialized `Buffer` you often see code
like this:

```js
var buf = new Buffer(16)

// Immediately overwrite the uninitialized buffer with data from another buffer
for (var i = 0; i < buf.length; i++) {
  buf[i] = otherBuf[i]
}
```


### Would this ever be a problem in real code?

Yes. It's surprisingly common to forget to check the type of your variables in a
dynamically-typed language like JavaScript.

Usually the consequences of assuming the wrong type is that your program crashes with an
uncaught exception. But the failure mode for forgetting to check the type of arguments to
the `Buffer` constructor is more catastrophic.

Here's an example of a vulnerable service that takes a JSON payload and converts it to
hex:

```js
// Take a JSON payload {str: "some string"} and convert it to hex
var server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  var data = ''
  req.setEncoding('utf8')
  req.on('data', function (chunk) {
    data += chunk
  })
  req.on('end', function () {
    var body = JSON.parse(data)
    res.end(new Buffer(body.str).toString('hex'))
  })
})

server.listen(8080)
```

In this example, an http client just has to send:

```json
{
  "str": 1000
}
```

and it will get back 1,000 bytes of uninitialized memory from the server.

This is a very serious bug. It's similar in severity to the
[the Heartbleed bug](http://heartbleed.com/) that allowed disclosure of OpenSSL process
memory by remote attackers.


### Which real-world packages were vulnerable?

#### [`bittorrent-dht`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bittorrent-dht)

[Mathias Buus](https://github.com/mafintosh) and I
([Feross Aboukhadijeh](http://feross.org/)) found this issue in one of our own packages,
[`bittorrent-dht`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bittorrent-dht). The bug would allow
anyone on the internet to send a series of messages to a user of `bittorrent-dht` and get
them to reveal 20 bytes at a time of uninitialized memory from the node.js process.

Here's
[the commit](https://github.com/feross/bittorrent-dht/commit/6c7da04025d5633699800a99ec3fbadf70ad35b8)
that fixed it. We released a new fixed version, created a
[Node Security Project disclosure](https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/68), and deprecated all
vulnerable versions on npm so users will get a warning to upgrade to a newer version.

#### [`ws`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws)

That got us wondering if there were other vulnerable packages. Sure enough, within a short
period of time, we found the same issue in [`ws`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws), the
most popular WebSocket implementation in node.js.

If certain APIs were called with `Number` parameters instead of `String` or `Buffer` as
expected, then uninitialized server memory would be disclosed to the remote peer.

These were the vulnerable methods:

```js
socket.send(number)
socket.ping(number)
socket.pong(number)
```

Here's a vulnerable socket server with some echo functionality:

```js
server.on('connection', function (socket) {
  socket.on('message', function (message) {
    message = JSON.parse(message)
    if (message.type === 'echo') {
      socket.send(message.data) // send back the user's message
    }
  })
})
```

`socket.send(number)` called on the server, will disclose server memory.

Here's [the release](https://github.com/websockets/ws/releases/tag/1.0.1) where the issue
was fixed, with a more detailed explanation. Props to
[Arnout Kazemier](https://github.com/3rd-Eden) for the quick fix. Here's the
[Node Security Project disclosure](https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/67).


### What's the solution?

It's important that node.js offers a fast way to get memory otherwise performance-critical
applications would needlessly get a lot slower.

But we need a better way to *signal our intent* as programmers. **When we want
uninitialized memory, we should request it explicitly.**

Sensitive functionality should not be packed into a developer-friendly API that loosely
accepts many different types. This type of API encourages the lazy practice of passing
variables in without checking the type very carefully.

#### A new API: `Buffer.allocUnsafe(number)`

The functionality of creating buffers with uninitialized memory should be part of another
API. We propose `Buffer.allocUnsafe(number)`. This way, it's not part of an API that
frequently gets user input of all sorts of different types passed into it.

```js
var buf = Buffer.allocUnsafe(16) // careful, uninitialized memory!

// Immediately overwrite the uninitialized buffer with data from another buffer
for (var i = 0; i < buf.length; i++) {
  buf[i] = otherBuf[i]
}
```


### How do we fix node.js core?

We sent [a PR to node.js core](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4514) (merged as
`semver-major`) which defends against one case:

```js
var str = 16
new Buffer(str, 'utf8')
```

In this situation, it's implied that the programmer intended the first argument to be a
string, since they passed an encoding as a second argument. Today, node.js will allocate
uninitialized memory in the case of `new Buffer(number, encoding)`, which is probably not
what the programmer intended.

But this is only a partial solution, since if the programmer does `new Buffer(variable)`
(without an `encoding` parameter) there's no way to know what they intended. If `variable`
is sometimes a number, then uninitialized memory will sometimes be returned.

### What's the real long-term fix?

We could deprecate and remove `new Buffer(number)` and use `Buffer.allocUnsafe(number)` when
we need uninitialized memory. But that would break 1000s of packages.

~~We believe the best solution is to:~~

~~1. Change `new Buffer(number)` to return safe, zeroed-out memory~~

~~2. Create a new API for creating uninitialized Buffers. We propose: `Buffer.allocUnsafe(number)`~~

#### Update

We now support adding three new APIs:

- `Buffer.from(value)` - convert from any type to a buffer
- `Buffer.alloc(size)` - create a zero-filled buffer
- `Buffer.allocUnsafe(size)` - create an uninitialized buffer with given size

This solves the core problem that affected `ws` and `bittorrent-dht` which is
`Buffer(variable)` getting tricked into taking a number argument.

This way, existing code continues working and the impact on the npm ecosystem will be
minimal. Over time, npm maintainers can migrate performance-critical code to use
`Buffer.allocUnsafe(number)` instead of `new Buffer(number)`.


### Conclusion

We think there's a serious design issue with the `Buffer` API as it exists today. It
promotes insecure software by putting high-risk functionality into a convenient API
with friendly "developer ergonomics".

This wasn't merely a theoretical exercise because we found the issue in some of the
most popular npm packages.

Fortunately, there's an easy fix that can be applied today. Use `safe-buffer` in place of
`buffer`.

```js
var Buffer = require('safe-buffer').Buffer
```

Eventually, we hope that node.js core can switch to this new, safer behavior. We believe
the impact on the ecosystem would be minimal since it's not a breaking change.
Well-maintained, popular packages would be updated to use `Buffer.alloc` quickly, while
older, insecure packages would magically become safe from this attack vector.

TweetNaCl.js Changelog
======================


v0.14.5
-------

* Fixed incomplete return types in TypeScript typings.
* Replaced COPYING.txt with LICENSE file, which now has public domain dedication
  text from The Unlicense. License fields in package.json and bower.json have
  been set to "Unlicense". The project was and will be in the public domain --
  this change just makes it easier for automated tools to know about this fact by
  using the widely recognized and SPDX-compatible template for public domain
  dedication.


v0.14.4
-------

* Added TypeScript type definitions (contributed by @AndSDev).
* Improved benchmarking code.


v0.14.3
-------

Fixed a bug in the fast version of Poly1305 and brought it back.

Thanks to @floodyberry for promptly responding and fixing the original C code:

> "The issue was not properly detecting if st->h was >= 2^130 - 5, coupled with
> [testing mistake] not catching the failure. The chance of the bug affecting
> anything in the real world is essentially zero luckily, but it's good to have
> it fixed."

https://github.com/floodyberry/poly1305-donna/issues/2#issuecomment-202698577


v0.14.2
-------

Switched Poly1305 fast version back to original (slow) version due to a bug.


v0.14.1
-------

No code changes, just tweaked packaging and added COPYING.txt.


v0.14.0
-------

* **Breaking change!** All functions from `nacl.util` have been removed. These
  functions are no longer available:

      nacl.util.decodeUTF8
      nacl.util.encodeUTF8
      nacl.util.decodeBase64
      nacl.util.encodeBase64

  If want to continue using them, you can include
  <https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-util-js> package:

      <script src="nacl.min.js"></script>
      <script src="nacl-util.min.js"></script>

  or

      var nacl = require('tweetnacl');
      nacl.util = require('tweetnacl-util');

  However it is recommended to use better packages that have wider
  compatibility and better performance. Functions from `nacl.util` were never
  intended to be robust solution for string conversion and were included for
  convenience: cryptography library is not the right place for them.

  Currently calling these functions will throw error pointing to
  `tweetnacl-util-js` (in the next version this error message will be removed).

* Improved detection of available random number generators, making it possible
  to use `nacl.randomBytes` and related functions in Web Workers without
  changes.

* Changes to testing (see README).


v0.13.3
-------

No code changes.

* Reverted license field in package.json to "Public domain".

* Fixed typo in README.


v0.13.2
-------

* Fixed undefined variable bug in fast version of Poly1305. No worries, this
  bug was *never* triggered.

* Specified CC0 public domain dedication.

* Updated development dependencies.


v0.13.1
-------

* Exclude `crypto` and `buffer` modules from browserify builds.


v0.13.0
-------

* Made `nacl-fast` the default version in NPM package. Now
  `require("tweetnacl")` will use fast version; to get the original version,
  use `require("tweetnacl/nacl.js")`.

* Cleanup temporary array after generating random bytes.


v0.12.2
-------

* Improved performance of curve operations, making `nacl.scalarMult`, `nacl.box`,
  `nacl.sign` and related functions up to 3x faste
