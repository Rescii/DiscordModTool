el` and `serial` iterators over list of items represented by arrays or objects.
Optionally it accepts abort function (should be synchronously return by iterator for each item), and terminates left over jobs upon an error event. For specific iteration order built-in (`ascending` and `descending`) and custom sort helpers also supported, via `asynckit.serialOrdered` method.

It ensures async operations to keep behavior more stable and prevent `Maximum call stack size exceeded` errors, from sync iterators.
